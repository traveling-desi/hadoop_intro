<p>When you are logged in you should try to find a unregistered ""nickname"" and register it. Once you get that done you can go to #freenode channel and request having a ""Cloak"" applied to your nickname.

<p>I 'm ""expanding"" a bit my blog app, and I came up with the necessity to save a set of values (namely my blog settings) in a place where they could be accessed from every Python module. I came up with the idea of creating a new GAE datastore called Data and save each value as a database tuple. The scheme of the entities looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>class Data(db.Model):
    name = db.StringProperty(required=True)
    textvalue = db.StringProperty(required=False)
    intvalue = db.IntegerProperty(required=False)
    lastedit = db.DateTimeProperty(auto_add = True)
</code></pre>
<p>I plan to store there stuff like the number of posts per page I want in the homepage, the number of written posts (so I don't have to count them each time I need to) and so on.</p>
<p>I'd like to know your opinions on this. Is it a good practice to do such things? Or should I store the values some other way?</p>

"64431"	""	"cs101 "	"100005175"	"<p>I posted <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/60158/feedback-on-the-course"" rel=""nofollow"">some feedback</a> which touched on this--I mentioned wanting to really work to be successful--but I'd like to expand on that a bit, here.</p>
<p>I studied math at uni, and if you'd say that a 'weeder course' is one that throws difficult material at students so they must either sink or swim, then nearly all of the classes I took were like this. And because I was able to 'swim', I very much liked the classes being that way, because they forced me to work hard and do my best, and as a result I learnt much more than if the course had moved more slowly in order to ensure that everyone learned the material equally.</p>
<p>Of course, if it were possible to teach the same amount of material, but have more students succeed, then I think that is certainly the right thing to do. But I'm not sure that's always possible. Or, where it is possible, I'm not sure that it's in general within the ability of the professors to do it.</p>
<p>For some online classes like Udacity offers, certainly people may continue trying and studying until they understand, but, realistically, not everyone is going to manage to do it within seven weeks, no matter how well explained or easy the material may be. There may be people who will struggle for seven weeks just trying to understand the first unit. And that's okay, because not everyone must learn at the same rate. But there is not such freedom if you are offering an in-person class at a university.</p>
<p>Basically, we must weigh the benefits of teaching a harder class vs. an easier class. Some people have said before me, here, that if the goal is to teach the most people the most knowledge, then weeding out any people at all is counterproductive. But if resources are scarce--teaching time, for example--then by weeding out a few of the worst performing students, all of the rest might benefit enough that it makes up for it. In a physical university, the people who are weeded out then must take a different class, maybe changing their major or perhaps they will even drop out altogether, and it's a shame, but it would be worse to serve everyone poorly than to serve most better and few poorly or not at all, I think. Certainly people are free to study on their own, but the universities must also limit the resources expended on each student.</p>
<p>The beauty of Udacity, though, is that it can offer classes of comparable difficulty to 'weeder' classes <i>without needing to actually weed out any students</i>. Even if a student is failing every homework assignment, they won't be forced out, and there's no incentive to force them out. So for online classes like this, the value calculus changes. Now you can just teach the best class possible, and continue to iterate until you serve better those who were poorly served at first, because the presence of poorly performing students doesn't hurt those who are performing well. People are free to continue to spend their time trying to learn for as long as they feel it's in their best interests.</p>
<p>So, I think that by all means Udacity should offer courses that are like weeder courses. Throw as much material as possible at students, and see what sticks. But also offer all the explanations and help that are needed to help <i>everyone</i> learn the material. Then, those who can learn the material more easily may continue to have lots of challenging material to study, and those who need more help may get it. And let the path through the course be chosen by the student. Already Udacity is like this--for those students who need no help with the homework, they may choose not to view the 'office hours' videos, and not to request help in the forums. For those who need more help, there are many avenues they may explore. If Udacity continues to build on this, then I think it may combine the best of both options. I hope that it does.</p>"	"answer"	"64092"	"64092"	"2012-04-13 21:24:56.059901+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100005175"	"2012-04-13 21:24:56.059901+00"	"85102"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>This deals with centripetal acceleration, which is a topic we didn't cover in class. To try to give you an intuitive feel for centripetal acceleration, let's say you are driving a car around a corner. When is it most likely to skid? Well, when you are going fast or when you are turning sharply. This skid out happens because friction can no longer provide the force necessary to keep you moving on your circular trajectory. </p>
<p>Moving in a circle (even at constant speed) is actually a form of acceleration. Remember, acceleration is changing velocity. Since velocity is a vector with both a size (speed) and a direction, you can actually have acceleration if all you are changing is your direction!</p>
<p>For a pendulum, your direction is changing most rapidly as it swings through the bottom.

<p>--- edit ---<br>
So finally I completely revamped the code to (1) remove some bugs and (2) compare more methods. So now the script reliably compares the performance of the following 4 methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>Naive resampling: the simplest and least performing method (in O(n^2))</li>
<li>Naive Binary-search: for each i=1..N, the search is now done with a binary search (complexity is now O(n.log(n))</li>
<li>Wheel: Sebastian's method</li>
<li>Wheel-modified: here, index is initialized at 1 and 2*omega_max is replaced by 2/N</li>

<p>Performance is measured according to 3 types of metrics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Distances: there are 3 of them (1) Sum (A(i) - B(i))^2 ; (2) Sum A(i)*|A(i)-B(i)| ; (3) Kullback divergence(A,B)</li>
<li>Miss rate: the %age of particles that have not survived to the resampling, despite having a &gt;0 importance weight</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: Sebastian's wheel method seems to perform quite similarly to the Naive-Binary method (which is confirmed by repeating the experience a good many times).<br>
<strong>Conclusion 2</strong>: The modified wheel resampler seems to perform a bit better than the original version: distance with the original omega is lower, it ""misses"" fewer particles (on average 5% less) and is much quicker. </p>
<p>To better understand the meaning of the metrics, I killed the Naive method (too slow) and added a null sampler which simply produces the initial sample (ie the re-sampler distribution is uniform over the initial particle set) ; this should give, for all 3 distance metrics,  a view of what a very poor sampling method does. Here is the outcome for N=50,000:</p>
<pre><code>Omega          |         N |  N * mean | N * stDev |   N * min |   N * max 
               :     50000 |  1.000000 |  1.003655 |  0.000031 | 12.279639

</code></pre>
<p>Again, the modified wheel resampler seems to perform better than the original one from all standpoints.</p>
<p>Finally, I ran the same tests with values for the step that replaces Sebastian's 2*omega_max : alpha/N for alpha=0.5,1,2,3,etc. Clearly, 2/N yields the best performance (best distance and best miss rate) of all tested values. Below is the script's output for alpha=0.5, 1, 2, 4:</p>

<p>Summary of all the specific python stuff learned: <a href=""http://www.udacity.com/file?file_key=agpzfnVkYWNpdHl1ckcLEgZDb3Vyc2UiBWNzMTAxDAsSCUNvdXJzZVJldiIHZmViMjAxMgwLEgRVbml0GNn3FAwLEgxBdHRhY2hlZEZpbGUYmPccDA"" rel=""nofollow"">link</a></p>
<p>So I'm realizing that this is really a very broad range of topics. Knowing basic data structures and control flow, there's a lot of directions. One thing that came to mind was a sudoku solver, which is boring, but not a trivial problem either. The most intuitive thing might be to adapt the web crawler into something more efficient or maybe to find things other than links. Or maybe a really simple cryptography exercise in using hash tables to encode and decode messages.</p>
<p>One thing that I now noticed wasn't covered cause of the way assignments had to be accepted is getting user input. In python it's really simple, if you type out </p>
<p><code>name = raw_input(""Enter your name: "")</code> </p>
<p>the user will be prompted for input and it'll automatically be stored in the variable name. </p>
<p>Kudos to you if you managed to read all the way to this line.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-04-01 07:10:51.046048+00"	"0"	"(wiki)"	"\N"	"100006877"	"2012-04-01 07:10:51.046048+00"	"70026"	"\N"	"\N"	"240"	"f"

Your result is something similar to the arithmetic mean (the sum of all elements divided by how many they are). </p>
<p>The median is different, it's the number in the middle, out of the three given numbers (it is used, for example, in some statistics, to estimate the average of something very quickly, without much computing=,</p>
<p>So your code needs to look for the one number out of the three that isn't the biggest nor the smallest. </p>
<p>By the way, the median of, say, five, or any other odd number of numbers is also the number in a middle. If the number of numbers is even, say 6, the median is the arithmetic mean of the middle two.

"65360"	""	"cs101 "	"100008221"	"<p>Why aren't more people using Lisp? Well, I'd give a couple of reasons.</p>
<p>First, out of habit (er, well, it could be argued that the next two-three ones are also about habit. Oh well). Lisp traditionally was a academic, AI-research language, used where computer resources were less controlled than in the industry. ""A Lisp programmer knows the value of everything and the cost of nothing"", and all that. Lisp systems could afford to waste cycles and memory, since for the AI researchers, the benefit and pure power of expression was the thing. In the industry, computers were used for mundane, repetitive tasks. Lisps expressive power was not needed, and it was too expensive in machine resources. Nowadays, those things are no longer relevant (the Lisp compilers are heaps better, the resources are plentiful, etc) but ""Real systems programming"" is still using languages from the legacy that came from Algol - Pascal - C - C++ and so on. Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM - That kind of thing</p>
<p>Secondly, because writing Lisp is Different(tm). Most computer languages give you a set of blocks, and programming is a matter of putting those blocks together to solve your problem. It is conceptually a bounded environment. Lisp gives you the tools to build your own blocks, and the problem rather becomes one of deciding what blocks would be useful to solve this problem, and then inventing them. What Kilaws talks about when he (?) talks about Lisp being a language to build languages in. It is of course possible to write Lisp programs that mirror more conventional programming styles, but to get to the power of the language, this is where you need to go. And that is a very different way of thinking. The language that is most similar to this style, I think, is Forth.</p>
<p>Thirdly, because the work environment is different. Lisp is (these days) usually programmed interactively and interpreted - A bit like Python, if you use something like IDLE, where you write your code file in one window and test it out at the Python prompt. Only, in Lisp you can do everything from there. You start off writing a few functions to try things out, write a few test cases. Crash out, and interactively debug your code (inspecting variable values at the crash site, back up or go forward, change a function definition in the running program and continue) Identify some common patterns that you abstract into a macro. Load a profiling package that you've written earlier and attach it to your already written functions. Find out that most of the time is spent in two particular functions, so you compile them to get a bit of performance boost. And so on. The functions you've written, the debugger, the compiler - Everything is at your fingers, interactively, at the prompt.  This is also very different, if you're used to the write-compile-test cycle with an external debugger, a compiler that compiles all or nothing, and so on. </p>
<p>Fourthly, because Lisp has so long been a part of academia, there hasn't really been development in the directions that other languages went. A general use language these days has a large standard library, access to GUI tools, stuff like that. It took a long time for Lisp to get these things (insofar as it still has them), because, well...academics... :D The situation is better today, but for a long time it has been behind in the glitz'n'gui departments.</p>
<p>Fifthly (is that even a word?), there is the heretical thought that maybe, just maybe, that power and expressivity isn't all that important in the real world, really. I shudder to write it down, but maybe it isn't really that good? Oh, who am I trying to fool - Of course it is :-)</p>"	"answer"	"64560"	"64560"	"2012-04-14 18:41:45.921058+00"	"4"	""	"\N"	"100008221"	"2012-04-14 18:41:45.921058+00"	"86384"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>For example, right now there is a thread concerning HW 4.5, our ""Better Splitter"" HW assignment. You can very clearly identify the difference in thinking in the main issue this thread is concerned about:</p>
<p>Namely, is the SPACE considered a special character? Well, to humans (and non-programmers ;) the space IS special because it represents the LACK of something. But the programmer realizes this is an illusion and that to the COMPUTER, there is no difference other than in a bit pattern. IOW, the COMPUTER simply ""sees"" a space as ANOTHER character (and so does the programmer) but a non-programmer thinks of a space as something being missing.</p>
<p>This is a VERY simple example, but if you go with it for awhile, you'll see that there are literally millions of little things like this that a non-programmer wouldn't consider, but a programmer does. An experienced programmer will not be fooled by these little ""gotchas"" and edge cases and such because she's SEEN them before...she DOES think differently than a non-programmer.</p>"	"answer"	"41246"	"41246"	"2012-03-18 13:05:13.725174+00"	"2"	""	"\N"	"100004586"	"2012-03-18 13:05:13.725174+00"	"54476"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

Yes, the human body does generate heat. Yes, that heat <em>could</em> be used as a source of energy. But in order to generate heat, the body must be supplied energy (food), and the amount of energy in that food will always be greater than the amount that could be gained from using the heat produced. The aliens should have just used whatever they were feeding the humans as their energy source. Unless I'm forgetting part of the movie.</p>
<p>As to what you said: Charge does flow in our bodies. Small electric fields are created in our bodies. There is energy in these fields. But to create these fields we need to expend more energy than we could reclaim from the field. </p>
<p>Energy transformations are inefficient. The human body is particularly bad. When we want to get some energy from somewhere, we want to transform that energy as few times as possible. </p>
<p>For example, think back to unit 4. A windmill can be used to do mechanical work (like lifting water out of the Netherlands) or it can be used to generate electrical power, which can THEN be converted to mechanical energy. This second option is less efficient than the first, since some energy is ""lost"" to heat in the transformation from mechanical energy (the spinning windmill) to electric energy and then more is lost in the transformation from electric back to mechanical (the turning screw). </p>
<p>Long story short: the matrix is a great movie built on a ridiculous premise. Great question.</p>

"63849"	""	"cs101 "	"100008230"	"<p>In the old days, in London or New York, the gentlemen's clubs were very powerful social organizations.  Those inside -- even if just the nephew of a member -- had powerful advantages over anyone on the outside, no matter what their personal qualities or skills.</p>
<p>Ivy League and world-class universities have functioned in much the same way, though sometimes more subtly.  Success in business has often been a matter of who you know rather than what you know.  Mere technical mastery would relegate you to the working class.</p>
<p>Entrepreneurship has offered a way to leapfrog into the upper ranks, at least to the extent that the nouveau riche can ever do so.  And computer science has offered a new and easy path to entrepreneurship, for those with chutzpah and entrepreneurial spirit.  Now Udacity and the like are offering an easy path into computer science.</p>
<p>But is that enough to compete with what one finds at Stanford?  In theory, yes.  In practice, I think the answer is ""seldom.""  To put it rather crudely, you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear -- nor can you make an entrepreneur out of a computer geek (Bill Gates excepted).  Stanford is in the business of screening out all but the most likely students to succeed, then nurturing them in an environment that demands initiative and expects success.  Some few of those graduates will go on to make major contributions to the endowment fund; hopefully the rest will have useful and satisfying lives.</p>
<p>Udacity certainly has the power to put isolated students on a path to greatness.  (For that matter, so does the Internet.  Or books.  Or a wealthy patron.  Or one good teacher.)  But for typical cases, online education lacks some important elements.</p>
<p>First is the screening.  Large universities use their introductory chemistry classes (or some other difficult course) to weed out the weak, from a student body that was carefully selected to begin with from valedictorians and high school/prep school leaders.  Udacity's CS101 has likewise whittled us down to perhaps as few a 100 students, judging from forum page views, but starting from a less-screened pool.  Yes, Udacity has worldwide reach, and hence will tap brilliance and expertise beyond Stanford's reach.  But still, the output of an online education will typically resemble the input of a Stanford education.</p>
<p>Second is the poor teaching often found at a large research university.  As grateful as we are for Dave's good instruction, let's recognize that Udacity is spoonfeeding us.  A short lecture, an easy quiz, a short test, all with feedback as to the right way to work the problems.  Step by step, we are lead to a packaged conclusion.  It is as if the instructor pulled out a favorite piece of code and spent the next seven weeks stepping us through the modules and statements and concepts.  Yes, it is educational, but in the end we learn only a little beyond that one piece of code.  Any school has to do much the same, but most will require far more book reading and lab work.  Further, bad teaching encourages independent student effort.  Students band into study groups for survival, and must sometimes prepare themselves for the final exam almost in spite of the instructor's efforts to draw them into his/her own research specialty.  The dynamics are complex and different for each class and student, but tend to inculcate social and educational skills you won't get from Udacity forums.</p>
<p>As @charlzz mentioned, there is also the issue of living at home instead of in a dorm.  My father was a professor, so I lived at home as an undergraduate.  It was a mistake.  I needed the experience of living with others of my own age and circumstances.  Not being social, I had little contact with other students outside class.  I remained a nerd.  And my grades suffered as well, though as an individual I was smart enough.  I like to think that I have turned out well, but I know that my poor socialization (originating in grade school and unrecognized ADHD) put me on the wrong path.  I wonder if Udacity isn't offering the same to most of its students.</p>"	"answer"	"63824"	"63824"	"2012-04-12 20:48:21.337582+00"	"1"	""	"200048"	"100005415"	"2012-04-12 21:45:53.014449+00"	"84371"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

Usually inverting a matrix can be a cumbersome task if done by hand, but consider that a normal PC will invert a non-sparse matrix of a thousand rows and colums in few milliseconds. Moreover, since the properties of the matrix (i.e. the fact that it is very sparse and that the position of non-zero elements) are well known, it is possible to write very efficient inversion algorithms that will perform only the necessary calculations. You could write an ""inverse_sparse_xy"" method that will correctly operate on the known matrix structure and you'd get back to very efficient.

"10010747"	""	"st101 "	"100007855"	"<p>Dear Ken,</p>
<p>Prof Thrun's and my computation for unit31-5 is as follows :-</p>
<p>Priors probabilities P(T=1)=P(T=2)=P(T=3)=1/3</p>
<p>Here P(T=k) (for k=1,2,3) denote the probability of the True location of the car.</p>
<p>The joint probability P(M=3,T=1)=1/3 (computed as 1/3 * 1),  P(M=3,T=2)=1/6 ( computed as 1/3 *1/2) ,  P(M=3,T=3)=0 ( computed as 1/3 * 0). Here we use the independence of 2 events to multiply their probability. Also we assume the player chooses door 2.</p>
<p>The likelihood, P(M=3|T=1)=P(M=3,T=1)/P(T=1)=(1/3)/(1/3)=1</p>
<p>P(T=1|M=3)=P(T=1,M=3)/P(M=3)</p>
<p>We first compute, P(M=3) = P(M=3|T=1)P(T=1) + P(M=3|T=2)P(T=2) + P(M=3|T=3)P(T=3) =  P(M=3,T=1)+P(M=3,T=2)+P(M=3,T=2) = 1/3 + 1/6 + 0 = 1/2 ( this is what I think Prof. Thrun is computing).</p>
<p>Hence <br>
 P(T=1|M=3) = P(M=3,T=1)/P(M=3) = (1/3)/(1/2) = 2/3<br>
 P(T=2|M=3) = P(M=3,T=2)/P(M=3) = (1/6)/(1/2) = 1/3<br>
 P(T=3|M=3) = P(M=3,T=3)/P(M=3) = 0/(1/2) = 0</p>
<p>My computation,using Baye's Rule is like this:-</p>
<p>Prior Probabilities are as above.<br>
Likelihood probabilities:-<br>
P(M=3|T=1) = 1<br>
P(M=3|T=2) = 1/2<br>
P(M=3|T=3) = 0<br>
The above is conditional to the player choosing door 2.<br>
Now we want the Posterior distributions,P(T=k|M=3),k=1,2,3.</p>
<p>P(T=k|M=3) = P(M=3|T=k)P(T=k)/P(M=3) for k=1,2,3. ---(i)</p>
<p>P(M=3)=P(M=3|T=1)P(T=1)+P(M=3|T=2)P(T=2)+P(M=3|T=3)P(T=3)=1.(1/3)+(1/2).(1/3) + 0.(1/3) = 1/2</p>
<p>Hence,by using (i),</p>
<p>P(T=1|M=3)=1.(1/3) / (1/2) = 2/3<br>
P(T=2|M=3)=(1/2)(1/3) / (1/2)=1/3</p>
<p>Now that I typed it out I think both the methods are the same. I would love to hear anyone's thought's on this. To me, Prof Thrun's quick method of dividing by the sum was not obvious,but now I think even he is simply using Baye's Rule.

<p>However, Dave was about to add more code after that loop in order to address the case that keyword wasn't found in index. If he HAD used break instead of return, that index.append([keyword, [url]]) line after the for-loop would have been executed even when the keyword WAS found, which would give a duplicate keyword entry in index. </p>

"184"	""	"cs101 "	"100008243"	"<p>It would be best to have all of these ideas rolled into a single community wiki, so here we go:</p>
<p><strong>Website/Videos</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Pop-up Python interpreter to follow along with the code in the videos.</li>
<li>When watching a video, if you click the ""Class List"" link at the top of the page, the list is brought up behind the video.</li>
<li>Showing the length of each video would be helpful in that it would allow students to allocate their time more appropriately and know how many videos they have time to watch. Also, showing the total video time for a given unit would be nice.</li>
<li>Having the introduction video start each time I load the ""course content"" page is very annoying. This should be changed so that the first video brought up is the next one I need to watch (or the previous one I watched, if I didn't finish it) and even then the video shouldn't start automatically.</li>
<li>Show the number of students registered for each course.</li>
<li>Localized times visible so people in different coutnries know when new lectures will be posted and when assignments/tests are due in their time zone.</li>
<li>Better instructions on how to access and complete quizzes. Quite possibly a full step-by-step tutorial would make the process easier.</li>
<li>An <strong>optional</strong> auto-play feature that will go from one video to another without user interaction.</li>
<li>Reference numbers for each video so that they may be easily tagged in questions on the forums.</li>
<li>Expected hours of work required for any given unit.</li>
<li>Summary video/section for each unit.</li>
<li>It would be nice to have an email sent out to all students when there is an important update to the site, such as a new homework assignment being posted.</li>
<li>When doing quizzes you are immediately given the answers if you get the question wrong even one time. This should be changed with an option to view the answers.</li>
<li>A more visible link to the forums is desirable; perhaps next to the 'Progress' link?</li>
<li>The importance of case (upper/lower) and white space in Python is not discussed.</li>
<li>Progress bars and game-like mechanics (see KhanAcademy) would be cool.</li>
<li>'To learn more'-type link at the end of a video for those bold enough to want more.</li>
<li>Mobile support, make the site more accessible for mobile devices.</li>
<li>A calendar for each course would be really cool. Populate it with the dates of homework assignments, new videos, tests, etc.</li>
<li>Because the videos are hosted on YouTube, they are unavailable from more than a few countries. How about a mirror site where the videos can be downloaded?</li>
<li>The emails sent regarding updates in questions contain bad links.</li>
<li>PDF version of homework assignment similar to that of the course notes.</li>
<li>Khan Academy style quizzes/homeworks. This stems from the idea that mastery is better determined by continuing to do problems until you get enough right, as opposed to simply getting a homework questions right or wrong.</li>
<li>Different video speeds are a great idea. Not everything will be new to all students and some students may need to go slower than others. The ability to play the video at 0.75x, 1.00x, and 1.50x speed would be very useful.</li>
<li>A list of software that would be beneficial to students taking the course (such as <a href=""http://python.org/getit/"" rel=""nofollow"">where to download Python 2.7</a> and <a href=""http://wiki.python.org/moin/IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironments"" rel=""nofollow"">which IDE to use</a>) would be tremendously helpful to new students with little programming background.</li>
<li>Until the answer videos are actually available, the 'Next' button should take students to the next question.</li>
<li>Links to additional exercises would be good for students who want to go above and beyond.</li>
<li>A single account for the main website and all forums would be ideal.</li>
<li>Fractional answers to quizzes/homework should be accepted.</li>
<li>In addition to auto-play, an auto buffer next video, if current has finished buffering option, if possible would be nice. With my slow internet, I'd have to open the next video in a new tab for it to start buffering after the current one has finished.</li>
<li>Add some (more)text in the instructor comments. The summary of the video from the units lecture notes would be just fine. Would give people with a slow internet with something to do while the video buffers. Though if you take a look at the <a href=""http://worrydream.com/Tangle/"" rel=""nofollow"">Tangle javascript library</a>, it would be nice if you could incorporate that into the instructor comments. Would make for nice, interactive notes that would add to the experience of learning.</li>
<li>Make it possible after due date to view the answer one submitted to the homework (to see if one forgot to click submit, or to see if maybe some modifications were made after due date which make it impossible to see why the homework was graded incorrect in retrospect)</li>
<li>Re-do the video lecture on TraceRoute (4.17) as there were many mistakes (192.168.1.1 being described as local host, not realizing that traceroute shows roundtrip delay, etc.) Re-do the homework question (4.4) that asks about latency to Cambridge from Palo Alto. Routers don't cause as much latency as the question assumes. The question and ""right"" answer are invalid because they are based on the misunderstanding about traceroute and roundtrip time. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Forums</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More intuitive formatting. Making this list caused me a great deal of annoyance.</li>
<li>Provide an option to show which courses a user is currently registered in/has previously completed.</li>
<li>The ability to message other users on the forum is definitely needed. </li>
<li>Optional subscribing to threads as opposed to the current auto-subscribing.</li>
<li>Actually limit daily voting. I currently have -2 votes left for today and can still vote on posts.</li>
<li>Make the FAQ button larger and more noticeable. Perhaps stick it on the bar with the links 'Questions', 'Tags', 'Users', etc.</li>
<li>Attempting to sort questions by 'hottest' gives a 504 error.</li>
<li>Community wiki's aren't editable by another other than the creator, despite karma. A short explanation should be given. - <strong>[This appears to be false]</strong></li>
<li>More than one answer can be accepted for any thread.</li>
<li>Karma is not rewarded when your comment gets voted up.</li>
<li>Suggest the use of standardized tags for commenting on homeworks/quizzes such as HW1.9, to help avoiding the multiplication of same questions on the same topic.</li>
<li>Consolidate forums with other courses?</li>
<li>Enable sticky posts for currently frequently asked questions, so the forums aren't spammed with 100 variations of the same problem.</li>
<li>There should be options to flag a question as 'Non-constructive' and 'Possible duplicate', in addition to the already available options.</li>
<li>A separate forum should exist for threads of general, non-course related discussions. This will have the added bonus of not clogging up the course forums with irrelevant material.</li>
<li>Having the formatting details shown when writing comments would be helpful.</li>
<li>Rather than requiring a separate account for each forum, link forum access to course enrollment and maintain posting statistics across courses.</li>

<br>obviously I am not an expert, so I don't dare saying Skiena is right or wrong.<br>
<br>Accordingly to what he says in his book, given a graph and a value k, it is possible to verify if k is the chromatic number of a graph in expected constant time. Therefore it would mean the problem is in NP.<br>
<br>Perhaps that ""expected"" could make a difference or not, but I believe Skiena is a much more reliable source than myself.<br>
<br><br>
<br>EDIT: on second thought, if the worst case is exponential, that would mean that at least one certificate could not be verified in poly time, which would make the problem not be in NP. And in such case either my interpretation of the book or the book itself is wrong.</p>"	"comment"	"11004731"	"11004305"	"2012-08-08 08:04:28.85856+00"	"0"	""	"11038375"	"100022094"	"2012-08-08 08:09:15.483216+00"	"11007100"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>One minor thing: when you move to take the standard deviation of x, it's still written as x(i) in the equation, which confused me at first.

"37922"	""	"cs101 "	"100008230"	"<p>I was thinking that we shouldn't include the HW4.6 modification because of the order in which the homework problems were presented.  If you wanted to include both of the modifications, it would make sense to implement click counts first, then modify that code to save only unique urls.  Then each problem need be solved only once.  In the order presented, the click counts have to be implemented one way in HW4.6 and then a different, more complex, way in HW4.7.  Doesn't make sense from a pedantic standpoint, and if it really were intended the instructions should have pointed out the need for modifying both routines.  It seems (or seemed) more likely that only the uniqueness modification is desired.</p>
<p>But Tomas's comment is correct: the HW4.7 answer can't be right in a real-world application if counts could be assigned arbitrarily to any of several urls.  Either the url should be made unique, as in HW4.6, or we are relying on the code to always increment the first instance and ignore all counts for duplicate keyword-url pairs.  The latter approach has possible uses, but we would use a different data structure instead of storing all those unreachable counts.  Clearly the instructor is heading toward the first option of having only unique urls for each keyword.</p>
<p>Both lines of reasoning seem valid, but useful function trumps pedantic elegance.  I'll go with including both modifications unless we get guidance otherwise.</p>

The thing about it is that majority of them falls into only few categories of repeating the same type of mostly silly mistakes. Thus, it looks as a good idea to collect them somewhere in order for everyone to be able to learn from that resource and do not make the same mistake again.</p>
<p>I will start with the ones I remember just from the top of my head and feel free to edit this post and add yours ""lessons learned"" (I am marking this post as community wiki in order for everyone to be able to directly edit it.):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Read the assignment very carefully and do exactly what you were asked for</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If it says ""print number of seconds"", do not print string ""Number of seconds is: %d"". Print only that number, you were asked for. Also make sure you looked at the comments under the video and that you really understand what you are supposed to do (e.g. this was my problem for the first question, where I did not notice the HTML below the video and simply marked all URL's, which had valid format).</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Distinguish between ""print"" and ""output""</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>While it is little confusing also for me, because when someone says ""output"", I understand ""print"", by default, this term was very clearly defined in Unit2.3 and following videos. Thus, distinguish between these: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>""print""</strong>: Print out something to standard output (do not confuse standard output a.k.a. <code>stdout</code> with <code>return</code>), i.e. <strong>use call to <code>print</code></strong>.</li>
<li><strong>""output""</strong>: Return something out from the function, i.e. <strong>use call to <code>return</code></strong>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Test, test, test!:</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Make sure you actually test your solution before submitting it. Try to cover especially border cases. Also make sure you test on correct environment, e.g. there are multiple versions of Python and they are not 100% compatible, thus even if you did extensive testing on your local Python installation, run it at least once (try to cover all lines of code) in the embedded online interpreter directly on this site in order to be sure that there are no compatibility issues.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make sure your output does not contain any extras, such as debug messages and the like</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>As Aleksey P stated in one of the threads, such code is not suitable neither for production nor for homework submission.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Make sure you DO NOT REPEAT anything from above the comment</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>This one seems pretty obvious, but it includes also cases, where many homeworks failed, because some variable defined above that comment was overwritten by some hardcoded value below it. In other words, don't copy what is above the comment to below it. If you do this, the grading software can not change the variable and test your code properly.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not hardcode ""magic values""</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If the question says that you have to find second occurrence of the target string and gives an example of search string <code>""De l'audace, encore de l'audace, toujours de l'audace""</code> and target string <code>""audace""</code>, make sure that your code does not look just for the string <code>""audace""</code>. You need to use input argument as a target string, instead.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not remove comments already there</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Removing comments can mean you remove the place the autograder is using to determine where your code starts so it can't check it.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not use Python's built-in identifiers for your own identifiers</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Albeit it will sometimes work (at least somehow) it definitely is not considered a good practice to ""recycle"" programming language's own built-in names (such as Python's <code>str</code>, <code>int</code>, <code>round</code>, <code>max</code>, etc.), because such ""recycled"" identifiers may clash with the original identifiers and produce unexpected or even undefined behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Do not submit ""multiple answers""</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If the assignment is wants you e.g. to implement a function XYZ and you know more than one solution, choose and submit exactly one of them. I.e. do not submit source code, containing multiple XYZ functions, each of them containing one of your correct solutions.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Measure twice and cut once</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Before submitting, reread the assignment again, check and recheck all the small details, such as name of the function you created, for the devil is in the details. Better to spend few more seconds on rechecking your work than be sorry after homework was graded.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Check your homework few hours before deadline</strong>:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It may happen, that some new hints will have appeared after your submission. It might be a good idea to check it and eventually rethink your answer if that is the case. Make sure that you do not resubmit wrong answer, though (e.g. in case you ran the code you do not want to be submitted as answer, recheck that it was not saved by some accident, etc. - see ""measure twice and cut once"" hint above).</p>

the solution D Kulakovsky posted above is exactly the way I solved the problem. Once you get to that disequality, you can find the correct minimum integer value (bigger than 1) that solves the problem by testing with different numbers. At some point you will find a couple of values (say n_0, n0+1) such that for n0 the disequality is not satisfied but for n0+1 it is. The value n0+1 is the value required</p>"	"comment"	"11004675"	"11004569"	"2012-08-08 00:59:44.059632+00"	"0"	""	"11038278"	"100022094"	"2012-08-08 01:00:23.605614+00"	"11007068"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>Since I couldn't find another way to post the equations here, I put the literal latex code which can be pasted into <a href=""http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php</a></p>
<hr>
<p>When multiplying the two gaussians, we get some constants term multiplied with some exponential term again. We can ignore the constant term, because that one has to be replaced with a new normalization factor anyway in order to make the result gaussian. The exponential multiply like this:</p>
<pre><code>e^{- {1 \over 2} {(x - \mu)^2 \over \sigma^2} } \cdot e^{- {1 \over 2} {(x - \nu)^2 \over \tau^2} } = e^{- {1 \over 2} \left( {(x - \mu)^2 \over \sigma^2} +  {(x - \nu)^2 \over \tau^2} \right ) }
</code></pre>
<p>Now, since the value of the exponent will always be negative, this function will reach its peak when the value in the parentheses is minimal. To calculate this minimum, we need to find the value x for which the first derivative is zero:</p>
<pre><code>{d \over dx} \left( {(x - \mu)^2 \over \sigma^2} + {(x - \nu)^2 \over \tau^2} \right ) = 2 \left ( {{x-\mu} \over \sigma^2} + {{x - \nu} \over \tau^2}\right ) = 0
</code></pre>
<p>When you solve this for x, you get:</p>
<pre><code>x = {{\nu\sigma^2 + \mu\tau^2} \over {\sigma^2 + \tau^2}}
</code></pre>
<p>This is obviously our new mean, because this is the position of the highest peak in the resulting function.</p>
<p>Now for calculating the variance, we use the fact, that the second derivative of the same term in the exponent of the gaussian function will be 2/sigma_2, which means it's not dependent on x or the mean anymore. So for our new gaussian with mu' and sigma', we should get the following equation:</p>
<pre><code>{{d^2}\over {dx^2}} {\left( {(x - \mu)^2 \over \sigma^2} + {(x - \nu)^2 \over \tau^2} \right )} = {{2\over \sigma^2} + {2 \over \tau^2 }} = {2 \over \sigma'^{2}} = {{d^2}\over {dx^2}} {\left( {(x - \mu')^2 \over \sigma'^2}\right )}
</code></pre>
<p>You can now solve this for sigma' and get the new variance:</p>
<pre><code>\sigma'^2 = {1 \over {{1\over\sigma^2}+{1\over\tau^2} }}
</code></pre>"	"answer"	"1011099"	"1011099"	"2012-03-03 12:19:28.790604+00"	"0"	""	"1043357"	"100003121"	"2012-03-03 12:43:27.685725+00"	"1015288"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

I suspect there are better ways to abuse my body. Am beginning to get comfortable working directly on the screen like my sons do but ensconced in bed, I keep putting off the intricate bits which may require the 'rough book' as we called the scratchpad in my childhood. </p>
<p>One can figure out how to improve efficiency and working convenience - come on Pro's - does it boil down to similar methods for all?? Please enlighten us noobs. A small tutorial on set-up would be welcome.</p>
<p>5 or 6 videos/quizzes within each unit, every day through the week, should take care of the schedule. Conversely, I doubt if I'd have solved the problems without the pressure of a deadline : ) The last two nights have been frustrating due to net issues and inexperience. Gah! Such is life!</p>
<p>HW2.7 submitted 2 minutes past deadline after the internet (my end surprisingly) went off at 2350UTC just as I was getting the nested loops out of the soup. I think there was some system changover from night to day rates. Before that my hotel room in Saudi Arabia had the internet connection unserviceable for the 1.5 days I had to myself over there. Some Murphy that Murphy. HW 2.6 pends.</p>
<p>But . . . I cannot easily replace the wonder at seeing what was once ""required reading"", yes all the way till 'twelve times' in primary school Grade 2 :</p>

"64421"	""	"cs101 "	"100008230"	"<p>I''m going out on a limb here, both because I know so little about you and because I am recommending a path that I have not followed.</p>
<p>You are getting advice to improve your coding skills via classes.  Great, if you can afford the time and cost, but those classes will simply put you in competition with all of the other graduates.  If what you need is a programming job, consider community college classes.  These are often sponsored by local industry and have ties to the local job market.  My wife once took a TAL class for instance -- the language for programming Tandem computers.  Not a big market for that, but there were jobs at Tandem for some of the graduates.  Community college graduates are also good candidates for sysop jobs and other infrastructure positions.  From there you can work your way into other programming positions, if you so choose.</p>
<p>Alternatively, contact local corporations directly and ask about their training programs.  Here's one in today's news: Facebook has just agreed to pay the city of Menlo Park $15M over 15 years for the right to exceed 3,600 on-site employees.  As part of the deal, Facebook has agreed to create a summer internship program for local high school students and to develop a local career training and outreach program; they will also be investing in affordable local housing.</p>
<p>If you can't get into a local training program, perhaps you can be hired for help desk work or some other peripheral task.  Then you can network inside the company and you get first crack at the internal job postings.</p>
<p>Another low-level entry route is to help people or small businesses with their personal computer problems, freelance or with a business service.  You need some skills to get hired for this, of course, but relatively few up-front skills if you freelance -- and it can be done part time.  Retired people sometimes get into computing by volunteering their services to local charities or school clubs, though of course that doesn't generate income.  Anyway, the point is to get started with what you know and then gradually add to your skills, rather than feel that you have to learn a dozen languages and systems up front.  The basic principle of getting hired is to find someone who has a problem and some budget authority, but who can't or doesn't want to do the work him/herself. Managers with problems and time constraints are easy to find, and budget is often available as well.  You just have to be willing to start with the work that no one else wants to do, at unattractive pay, on obsolete systems, in a language no one cares about -- or some subset of the above.  And you have to sell yourself, on your initiative, personality, and potential if not on your skills.  (Skills can be trained, or self-trained.)</p>
<p>In general, I would recommend getting experience over getting a degree.  But talk to some Personnel directors; see what they say.  And ask managers to explain the kind of coding/programming/IT experience they are looking for.  Check with you nearest ACM or IEEE chapters (or equivalent) as well; the officers and members will probably be happy to advise you, even if you are not a member.</p>"	"answer"	"64282"	"64282"	"2012-04-13 21:19:48.15178+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100008230"	"2012-04-13 21:19:48.15178+00"	"85089"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

"26924"	"HW2.5 Collatz Conjecture prove attempt"	"cs101 loops hw2.5 collatz conjecture prove"	"100007193"	"<p>The homework 2.5 became very interesting due to its nature... here comes my few pennies to the homework dealing with the Collatz conjecture..</p>
<p>Well, so, we have still few weeks to prove that the serie converges to 1 in order to get the full credits :-)</p>
<p>There are no proves yet, so let's ""propose"" this ;-) ....</p>
<p>OK, so what do we know about the serie? First of all, the serie converges to 1, if the iterated value (or plain) n becomes or is of the power of two (as 1,2,4,etc =&gt; ...,4,2,1).</p>
<p>Therefore for some point of time, regardless how long we calculated, iterated and how many rounds of n we have made in our function, the following statement must be true in order to converge to 1:</p>
<p>3x + 1 = x^2</p>
<p>Therefore, if this is ""not true or it cannot be true"" =&gt; there must be a non-real (complex) number solution to this =&gt; there exists a value that makes our code loop forever.<br>
In other words, the equation must have a solution producing only real numbers, thus having always a real solution.</p>
<p>Note that we are not interested by the x ""or n"" itself in the proving, but the equation only, that it has a solution in the world of real numbers - no imaginary parts/numbers whatsoever. In such an imaginary case, we expect only an eternal loop.<br>
The idea is somewhat like proving that ""the plane 3x+1 cuts the plane x^2"".</p>
<p>From that point of view we need to show that there is always (real) value solution to our equation.</p>
<p>Let's modify the equation a bit</p>
<p>3x + 1 = x^2</p>
<p>=&gt; x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0</p>
<p>=&gt; 1*x^2 - 3x - 1 = 0</p>
<p>Remember from math lessons that:<br>
ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a is not 0</p>
<p>=&gt; x = (-b [+-] sqrt(b^2 - 4<em>a</em>c))/2*a</p>
<p>The square root part (b^2 - 4<em>a</em>c) is called discriminant D.<br>
So, these holds:</p>
<p>( 1 ) if D &gt; 0, then the equation has two real value solutions x1, x2 (ok in our case, as we need to show that there exists a real value solution whatever n is)</p>
<p>( 2 ) if D = 0, then the equation has a doubled solution x1 = x2 (ok in our case as above)</p>
<p>( 3 ) if D &lt; 0, then the equation does not have real number solutions =&gt; meaning that there are not any chances to solve our problem, i.e. there exists a value n that is not real (ie., complex)), ""the planes do not cut"", and that causes the eternal loop</p>
<p>So, for our purpose it is enough to show that the discriminant is equal or bigger than 0 to be sure that our loop stops.</p>
<p>To apply that info to our equation:</p>
<p>x = (-(-3) [+-] sqrt( (-3)^2 - 4<em>1</em>(-1) ) ) / ( 2 * 1 )</p>
<p>=&gt; x = ( 3 [+-] sqrt( 9 - (-4) ) ) / 2</p>
<p>=&gt; x = ( 3 [+-] sqrt(9+4) ) / 2</p>
<p>=&gt; x = ( 3 [+-] sqrt(13) ) / 2</p>
<p>=&gt; x1 = ( 3 + sqrt(13) ) / 2<br>
=&gt; x2 = ( 3 - sqrt(13) ) / 2</p>
<p>Discriminant D = 13<br>
=&gt;<br>
A) because D is positive, there always is a real number solution =&gt; the loop (n) converges always at some point of time to 1 via the squared serie. ""The planes cuts each other""</p>
<p>B) because D is not negative (solution is not a complex number), does not loop forever, i.e., converges always to 1 meaning that while loop stops at some point of time with whatever n is.</p>
<p>There is always a real solution to our ""3x + 1 = x^2"" equation, meaning that the 3x+1 plane cuts the squared plane (x^2) at some point and the loop ends via the serie of (.., 4, 2, 1). The equality proves the cutting of the planes.</p>
<p>3 * (( 3 + sqrt(13) ) / 2) + 1 == (( 3 + sqrt(13) ) / 2) ^ 2)</p>
<p>10.908... == 10.908...</p>
<p>Proved.</p>
<p>... or...<br>

<p>First: yes, I took this course, but not in the same way that all of you probably have. Part of my job is to review the units after they are edited, which means I have to go through every video, make sure there are no obvious content or editing mistakes, and then start putting together the quizzes and programming exercises. The review phase has to happen quickly, which means I don't always get to attempt each programming exercise before I have to watch the solution video.</p>
<p>That being said, I tried to solve as many programming exercises and homework problems as I could squeeze in.</p>
<p>Was this course easy? No! But I love challenging courses, so I had a really fun time solving the problems that I did. There would also be occasions when I would be watching a solution video and be so excited by the elegance of a solution that I would pause, call over all the Udacity engineers, and show the solution to them. For example, the function which creates a scrabble board from only 1/4 of a board in unit 6 is something that I really appreciated. Physicists love symmetry, and I really liked that Peter was able to identify a symmetry in this problem and use it to his advantage. When I called the engineers over for this one the office basically stopped working for 30 minutes while we discussed it. </p>
<p>As far as my experience before this: I am very new to both Python and programming in general. Before Udacity, my programming experience was limited to some basic matlab scripts to analyze data and fit curves. In February I TA'ed CS 373 and took CS 101 and learned a lot through those courses and through discussions with Peter Chapman (one of the other TAs). So yes, I learned a TON of new tricks (some of which I posted on Andy's Corner and the Python Glossary, which I hope were helpful for the students who were new to programming). Generator expressions, decorators, and memoization are some of my favorite new 'tricks.'</p>
<p>I think the three biggest take aways from this course for me are the importance of selecting the right representation for a problem (as in, should I model this as a set? A list of lists? A string?); the necessity of planning when solving big problems; and the importance of modularity in code. The functions that I write now are much shorter, accomplish one specific task, and are therefore much more modular, useful, and easy to debug than they used to be.</p>

<p>You bring up a good point, and it's one we've thought a lot about. There is definitely a tradeoff between showing solutions immediately versus waiting. The compromise we've decided on is to show solutions during <em>lectures</em>, but to delay showing solutions on <em>homework</em>. You can always force yourself not to view the lecture solution videos (though I know that the ""solution"" button can be pretty tempting when you are stuck on a problem).</p>"	"answer"	"5008460"	"5008460"	"2012-05-08 18:42:52.00822+00"	"2"	"(accepted)"	"\N"	"100028529"	"2012-05-08 22:09:25.809942+00"	"5012111"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"t"

<p>Rather than trying to answer all those posts individually, here's a guide.  I hope it helps.  Please, anyone, jump in with corrections, suggestions, exceptions, etc.  This is marked community wiki.</p>
<p><strong>Print, or Not?</strong></p>
<p>There are 3 possible situations in this class, thus far:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The quiz/homework wants you to <em>write a procedure</em> that ""returns"" or ""outputs"" or ""produces"" some specific result.  That means your procedure, beginning with the 'def' statement, will have one or more 'return' statements somewhere (often at the end).  You will write the desired result immediately following the 'return' word, as in, 'return p'.  When that 'return' is executed, the result will ""return"" or ""output"" BACK to the program line that ""called"" (used) the procedure.  There is NO printing involved.  DO NOT use a 'print' anywhere!  The auto-grader, which is itself a program, will call (use) your procedure, and check that it gives back the right result.  This is probably the most common case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quiz/homework wants you to <em>write a program</em> that prints some specific result -- the wording will say ""print"" explicitly.  The context should be clear that it's the PROGRAM doing the printing, NOT a procedure.  Thus, even if writing a procedure is involved, any 'print' statements go OUTSIDE your procedures.  DO NOT put a 'print' anywhere inside a procedure in this case!  Do the printing in the body of the program, not indented under a 'def'.  The auto-grader will run your entire program, and look to see that the right result is printed out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The quiz/homework wants you to <em>write a procedure</em> that prints some specific result.  The wording will explicitly say to write or make a procedure, and have it print something.  In this case, you put the 'print' statements INSIDE the procedure, somewhere under the 'def'.  There need not be any result returned if all the procedure must do is print something.  However, it's possible for a procedure to do both:  print something, and also return a result.  Read carefully to clarify.  The auto-grader will call your procedure, and check that it prints out the right result.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Other situations are possible, but these are what we've seen so far, as far as I can remember.  If a more complicated case comes up, try to figure it out by breaking apart the problem into a combination of two or more of these three cases.</p>
<p>One other note:  it's a good idea to use temporary 'print' statements liberally for testing.  Put them any place in your programs and procedures that helps you figure out if what you wrote works correctly.  But don't forget to remove them again before submitting!</p>
<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If the problem is to ""write a procedure"" that ""outputs"" or ""returns"" or ""produces,"" then NO 'print' should appear anywhere.  Use a 'return' to complete the procedure.</li>
<li>If the problem is to ""write a program"" that ""prints"" something, your 'print' statements go OUTSIDE any procedures.</li>
<li>If the problem is to ""write a procedure"" that ""prints"" something, your 'print' statements go INSIDE the procedure.</li>

<p>Thanks for asking about Saylor.org! I'm the Community &amp; External Affairs Manager for the Saylor Foundation, and wanted to fill you in on a couple of aspects about Saylor.org. </p>
<p>Regarding our business model: we are an operating 501(c)(3) Foundation. It is our mission to provide all of our educational courses and associated resources (like textbooks, our ePortfolio, and more) for free. We will never charge our students to take a course or for a certificate of completion.</p>
<p>And to Vincin's point about universities offering credits for these free educational resources, we are working to make that happen for students that are interested in formal credits. This year, we've announced partnerships with StraighterLine and Excelsior College that will allow students to take select courses at Saylor.org and then pay a small fee to either StraighterLine or Excelsior to take a credit-bearing exam built upon those particular courses. If you have any questions about our efforts to build college credit partnerships, you can send an email to Devon Ritter who's heading up our student/credit partnerships effort at devon.ritter@saylor.org.</p>
<p>Thanks, and best of luck with your studies!</p>

The majority of all business metrics visualisations are bar charts (or line charts incorrectly used instead of bar charts), because you want to know how metrics change over time.</p>

"28528"	"Homework2.5: Bonus Question"	"cs101 collatz-conjecture hw2.5 homework"	"100008647"	"<p>I spent last hour or so reading various comments on homework question 2.5.3 and I am under impression, that some kind of union will eventually form and then declare a general strike of some sort. :) So I have a bonus question for HW2.5:</p>
<p>Why are you taking this course?</p>
<p>a) To get (arguably useless) sheet of paper with some numbers and signatures on it.</p>
<p>b) To learn something.</p>
<p>In case your answer was a), then please note that at least for now (I can't predict future though and actually I hope they will manage something like that), that sheet of paper is virtually useless, since Udacity has no accreditation (and as far as I know they are not searching to obtain any, but again, I can be mistaken). Moreover, if I was an employer (in fact I was for a time and I hardly looked at resumes and formal education of candidates - partially because of the poor state of universities in this part of the world and partially because of I prefer to trust what I see myself, not what others tell to me I should believe.), I would not give such a paper any credit, since it can not be proved that you earned it yourself and you were not helped by some friend or so - Internet is very strange place to be, in this respect.</p>
<p>I can second the motion:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>that the partial scoring would be ""more fair"" (but how is ""fair"" defined and what actually is ""fair"", after all?),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that it is not the best practice to change assignments (hints and function definitions added) after they were aired and already solved by many,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that this question was tricky and should have been part of quiz, rather than homework, or at least homework in some later unit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, when rising up such motions, one should notice also those four letters to the right of the ""Udacity"" logo at each page (saying ""BETA""). In fact, Udacity had only one experience with such an endeavour - the Standford AI class. This one is only the second one. That is reason for that ""BETA"" thingie. They are still learning and working around the clock to deal with all day-to-day problems (such as heavy traffic peak due to an article in really popular medium). They are also only people such as me and you and they need to do a few mistakes before ""BETA"" can go away. Let's try to give them that opportunity - they need it and I think they deserve it and also that they will do their best to use it. Also, let's not forget that we are getting all of this for <strong>free</strong>!</p>
<p>Anyway, I can not help myself, but I think that this was the best question from HW2 - because, as I wrote in my other posts, it gives very little example of how programmers job in real life truly looks like. You are not inventing a wheel most of the time (unless you are a researcher, but that is not typical programmer's job). In case you want to be productive, you do not have that luxury - deadlines are tough, customer does not really know what he wants (it is your job to find out), functional specification is incomplete and sometimes it is also contradicting itself (business analyst is also only a man), code you are working on consists of few million (and more) lines of code and 90% of it looks like the one who wrote it was just in process of learning the language he used, testers are submitting bug tickets saying only ""something is not working"" without any closer specification nor debug trace, 3 from 5 of your key team members get really ill right before the deadline etc etc. Thus you do not have any time to play brain-teasing games. When you need to find a solution to your problem, you search the web (or other resources at hand). And it is usually much harder than HW2.5.3 assignment, because you need to overcome all of the above mentioned problems and still deliver quality code and deliver it on time. Otherwise your customer will not be satisfied and you are risking not getting your salary (even more, if you are a freelancer).</p>
<p>So, my message in short is: <strong>Do not complain about HW2.5.3, because it will not do you any good - you will just waste lots of time - the most valuable of all goods known to humanity. Instead, take it as a great opportunity to learn something...</strong></p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-03-09 01:30:53.585949+00"	"6"	""	"91694"	"100003289"	"2012-03-09 02:04:45.142943+00"	"37302"	"\N"	"\N"	"255"	"f"

<br>thanks for sharing your opinion as well.

<p>Firstly, the mini-units don't have titles. ""Unit 8 Optional"", ""Unit 9 Optional"", ""Unit 10 Optional"", ... don't make it easy for pick-and-choose-ing.</p>

<p>Having these topics in a separate course, imo, would actually greatly boost accessibility, boost organization, motivate more students, and much more.

</blockquote>
<p>The statement ""If the list has zero or one elements, it is already sorted."" is referring to your quicksort procedure not to the ordered_search procedure. It is essentially giving you a hint (or rather a very obvious statement) as to the base case of your quicksort procedure. As you pivot and split into 2 lists and then make recursive calls to quicksort, it will eventually happen that either a [] or list with 1 url will get passed to quicksort. </p>"	"answer"	"51360"	"51360"	"2012-04-01 20:42:35.882935+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100004414"	"2012-04-01 20:42:35.882935+00"	"70556"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>One topic that I would like to know about, is how to have a global knowledge of what to use when we have several options. <br>
Like, for example, I was very happy when I found out on the web how to use filter, map, and functions like that. But then, few hours later, I've read an article of python creator, saying why not to use them, and his opinion on removing them from the language. So then I began to learn about list comprehensions. <br>
The same goes for how do we know if something is ""well"" implemented in python, in terms of efficiency, like what you mention about recursion.</p>
<p>So, what I mean is, that it seems that Python language evolves fast, and many examples, tests, and documentation on the web a very outdated... and it is not enough to see the date, maybe something that worked a year ago, does not work anymore, or it is no loger the better way to do things.<br>
I dont know if it is possible to do a unit on ""what not to use""... but I dont know how to overcome this issue when learning python, given the randomness of how one finds information on the web.</p>
<p>Dave, it would be nice if you could comment on this.<br>

<p>I think you're talking about the Zebra Puzzle. I'm afraid I don't have any wisdom to shed on this puzzle beyond the statement in class.  The idea of the problem is to start with a very vague statement ""there are five houses,"" in which the number of possible orderings is very large. Then, you impose constraints ""the Englishman lives in the red house."" Each constraint reduces the number of possible orderings until there is only one left. I tried solving this problem without python's help and gave up after 10 mins of trying to keep everything straight.

If there's an 'idea' at all, it's that letting a heap grow by adding smaller stuff at the top doesn't create that much extra work because, since you always add smaller stuff, it's only the top of the heap pyramid that matters.

This set should work the same regardless of improvements made to lookup(). I also
removed some checks of special cases - e.g. calling record_user_click() with
non-existant keywords or urls. See the other set if you want to test these cases.

<p>I do NOT, repeat NOT call downvoting bullying, and I have not asked anyone to abstain from downvoting.</p>
<p>I've asked people to stop bullying people who are simply confused and trying to get questions answered. That's very different, and I'm sorry you can't seem to see the difference.</p>
<p>You're welcome to downvote my post, for example. I presume you already have. I don't object to that at all.</p>
<p>What I'm objecting to is attempts to intimidate people who need help from posting. They may be going about it wrong. They may be doing things which bother you. But they don't deserve to be attacked for it, and if downvoting is <em>part of such an attack</em>, then I object.</p>
<p>If you can't understand such a distinction, then of course you're going to miss the whole point -- and if you're doing that, then I probably can't get you to change your behavior.</p>
<p>But this topic has 50+ votes, so some people get it.</p>
<p>Do feel free to downvote comments that don't contribute to the discussion or answer the question, or do it wrong, or are unclear, whatever.</p>
<p>But don't insult someone for posting a question, and then downvote it. Especially not if they seem lost and clueless!</p>
<p>If the question has no general interest, just don't upvote it. If it is destructive somehow -- like if you took my coding challenge as insulting to Sebastian, vote that down.</p>
<p>Feel free to vote me down whenever you like. I'm pretty much bully-proof.</p>
<p>But please, consider the people behind these posts as <em>people</em>, and treat them with a little respect.</p>
<p>That's all I'm asking for. Not a ban on downvoting. There's no inconsistency here at all.</p>"	"comment"	"1020613"	"1020502"	"2012-03-15 20:08:53.492465+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100010063"	"2012-03-15 20:08:53.492465+00"	"1028870"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>In the equation $%F=ma$%, the ""m"" is somehow a measure of how difficult it is too get an object moving. The greater the m, the more difficult it is to accelerate an object. This idea of difficulty-to-move we call inertia. So the m in $%F=ma$% refers to the object's <strong>inertial mass</strong></p>
<p>There is another property that objects have. We can call that property ""How much an object reacts to gravity."" THAT is the m in $%mg$%, and we can call that the <strong>gravitational mass</strong> of an object.</p>
<p>So we have these two ENTIRELY DIFFERENT properties of objects. 1- how hard it is to get an object moving and 2- how much an object responds to gravity. </p>

<p>This coefficient depends, as you would expect, on both the object and the surface: a ball dropped on sand will not bounce as high as a ball dropped on a hard surface.</p>"	"answer"	"9007545"	"9007545"	"2012-08-11 17:20:54.74498+00"	"1"	""	"\N"	"100007518"	"2012-08-11 17:20:54.74498+00"	"9010009"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

From the point of view of someone on the side of the road, when you jump up, you aren't jumping straight up. You also have some horizontal velocity due to the motion of the truck. In fact, you have the same horizontal velocity as your truck! So if the truck is moving at 10 mph, then when you jump up, you are also jumping forward (from their point of view) at 10 mph.  When you land, you and the truck have each moved forward by the same amount, and therefore you land in the same spot on the bed of the truck.</p>
<p>From your point of view: well motion at constant velocity is the same as being at rest.

I reject the argument in the Wikipedia paragraph labeled ""A Common Resolution.""  (There is nothing wrong with the expectation in Step 7, and the alternative formula in terms of X is correct but useless.)  The rest of the arguments I either haven't read or don't understand.  But they seem to hinge on exceedingly fine distinctions, and the randomness of the prize amounts is one of them.</p>
<p>My own preference is to treat them as random variables, as that gives me a handle on probabilistic analysis.  Otherwise the envelopes contain two completely unknown random numbers, and I have no clue from one as to what the other may be.  That's OK for the logical paradox, as the claim is that the two envelopes should be equivalent and thus we must be making an error if we calculate that they are not.  But you posed a different problem, stating that the two choices are not equivalent.</p>
<p>My statement that you quote above does sound very much like the Wikipedia solution, but the interpretation is different.  My approach depends on the number of significant digits; I don't see anything about that in the Wikipedia discussion of Z.  Instead, it is saying that because of the normalized nature of probability distributions, the broader the distribution, the lower the probability of any particular random value (to within its representational width).  [Note: This assumes that one end of the distribution starts at zero.]  We can find a member Z of a class of exponentially decreasing functions such that we can use it as a threshold test.  The larger the first prize, the more spread out we can assume the prize distribution to be and the lower the value of Z that will serve as our threshold.</p>
<p>That's deep stuff, beyond my current mathematical abilities.</p>
<p>As to whether my solution would work better: yeah, I think it probably would, for most realistic prize offerings.  As would Sergei's, I imagine.

(All other versions require that the lesser prize be half the greater one.  I particularly like Raymond Smullyan's non-stochastic version.)  I hadn't run across this before.</p>
<p>I disavow having solved this in the manner you describe.  All my suggestions had to do with cultural constraints on the method of generating the prize amounts or their representations.  The solution you describe works to some extent for any generating distribution, and for fully random real numbers.</p>

If you throw horizontally a distance of 10 m and we assume that your arm is about one meter above the ground, then the time spent in the air can be calculated by saying $$\frac{1}{2}gt^2 = 1$$ This tells us that the ball spent about 0.45 seconds in the air. We also know that the initial velocity with which you threw the ball $%v_0$%, times $%t$% must be 10 meters. Since we now know $%t$%, we know that you must have thrown the ball at about $%v_0 = 22.4 m/s$%.</p>
<p>If you threw a ball upwards at that speed, we know that the velocity at the top is zero, and we know that $% v = v_0 + at$%. Setting $%v = 0$% and using our $%v_0$% of 22.4 and $%a=-10$%, we find that the ball spends 2.24 seconds going upwards. This will be our $%t$% in $%\Delta x = v_0t + \frac{1}{2}at^2$%. When we plug in everything we have, we find that $%\Delta x = 25$% meters.

"9007166"	""	"ph100 "	"100007518"	"<p>This seems like a flawed problem to me. If the monkey is swinging as the problem states, it is impossible for such a balance. The tension in the rope would actually be greater than the monkey's weight as the rope swings through the bottom (we didn't talk about this subject in this course, but it is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centripetal_force"" rel=""nofollow"">centripetal force</a>) and less than the monkey's weight as it reaches one of the high points of its motion. </p>
<p>But, let's assume the swinging wasn't actually happening and the monkey is just suspended from this rope. In this case I agree with Narrina. Monkey and weight both accelerate upwards. This is a tricky question though. I was initially tempted to say that the weight goes up and the monkey goes down, but from an energy point of view that didn't make sense (for a few reasons, but the reason that came to my mind first was something called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum"" rel=""nofollow"">conservation of angular momentum</a>, which we unfortunately didn't cover in this class). </p>
<p>Once I felt like the monkey had to go up too, I was confused for a minute because it seemed like the monkey was somehow generating energy out of nothing. My <strong>wrong</strong> reasoning went as follows: As the monkey climbs up the rope, he does a certain amount of work. That work goes towards increasing his kinetic energy and offsetting the work done by gravity, thus giving the monkey potential energy, from the standpoint of the monkey, <em>he can't tell the difference between this situation and the situation of climbing a rope that was tied to a branch high in the tree</em>. But this leads to a problem. Because as the monkey gains PE and KE, SO DOES THE WEIGHT ON THE OTHER END! What's going on!? Where is this energy coming from?</p>
<p>Well, it turns out I made a mistake. The monkey CAN tell the difference between climbing this rope and climbing a rope that is tied to a branch, because <em>this rope is accelerating downwards!</em> This means that the monkey actually has to do twice as much work as he would have if the rope were tied off. This explains the ""extra"" energy in the other mass.

But I think that you have misunderstood what Adam meant by ""extremeness"". In the question video he says: ""how is extreme is our <strong>prediction</strong> of y compared to x"". He wants to know how much a single data point ""x"" deviates from the average when compared with its prediction ""y"", i.e., we are comparing their z scores. The standard deviation measures how much the data as a whole (being the average of squared differences $%(x-\mu)$%) deviates from the average. You can't use standard deviation to measure ""extremeness"" as it was defined. So, given that $%|r|&lt;0$%, $%|Z_{y}|$% will always be smaller than $%z_{x}$%, and therefore $%y$% will be always less extreme than $%x$% in this case. But you're correct that they could be equally extreme if $%|r| = 1$%. So a more precise statement (without the assumption that $%|r| &lt; 1$%) would be ""y is at most as extreme as x"". Although in practice, I think it's unlikely that you would find a perfect correlation between $%y$% and $%x$%. Good point though, I'll make the statement more clear, by adding the constraint $%|r|&lt;1$%. Thank you again. :)</p>"	"comment"	"10010319"	"10010146"	"2012-08-05 08:05:16.262988+00"	"1"	""	"10118559"	"100012003"	"2012-08-05 08:06:18.41372+00"	"10014648"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>Thank you for your thoughtful reply.  You are definitely correct that the problem is in the English language, not in the mathematics.  In English, you ""ignore"" a person by not paying any attention to what they are saying.  This is not what you are doing when you omit outliers.  Instead, you are paying very close attention to them, and then making a decision to not include this data point in your analysis.  So, you are not ""ignoring"" what the data is telling you.  In fact, if you ""ignored"" the data, that would mean you are not paying attention to it, which means that you would never find any outliers! </p>
<p>With regards to the theoretical, mathematical approach to the course, while the ""hands on"" format is great, there are many intuitive gaps that are not covered properly.  For example, z scores is one of the most important concepts in statistics as it allows you to compare vastly different distributions and determine the relative position of specific data points from each distribution.  This concept should be emphasized much more at the expense of other, more abstruse and less useful concepts.</p>
<p>My point being that an experienced statistics professor should have been used to design and teach this course.  I think that the physics course is better for that reason than this course is. </p>

If you already pretty much know what you're looking for, the lines really let you see how after a change in time, <code>dt</code>, every possible state has evolved in the way it would have if the object really were in that state. That is, every point <code>(x,v)</code> in this state-space moves to the point <code>(x+v*dt, v)</code>.</p>
<p>The thing that is confusing about the grid lines, though, is that in the update frame, the numbers on the position axis still represent the position that the state would have been in at a time <code>dt</code> ago. The position of where it is now would still be given by the grid lines as drawn in rest of the frames. Perhaps it would be useful to indicate this distinction somehow. You could draw either the new or (as I would probably prefer) the old axes lines and numbers in a different color, and then give an indication in the legend that the slanted lines represent the old position of the states that they intersect. And then show that the time has advanced.</p>
<p>Also, it's possible that the confusion is made worse by the inclusion of negative velocities on the plot. The result of doing this is that the axes numbers are moving in the negative position direction, while almost all of the region corresponding to the states we are interested in is moving in the positive position direction. (Although I guess there is some value in including zero velocity states, since those are the fixed points. And if you stopped at 0, then it would be harder to add the distinction in times I was looking talking about before.)</p>
<p>Finally, and related to the first point, it would probably be nice to have some labels on both of the axes. That's just the middle-school math teacher coming out in me.</p>

<p>There´s a detail that would be interesting to study with a little more detail and that as to do with the turning instant. When does the period change from decreasing to increasing? That instant is not (for sure) the instant water has drained all out because the center of gravity does not change instantaneously from the down position to the up position! The reason is because the lesser the water inside the sphere, the lesser it will contribute to the center of gravity of the hollow sphere plus water. In resume, the center of gravity will go down as the water falls down but there will be an instant, during this fall and before water as all drain out, where the center of gravity will star to go up again. </p>

<p>two quick, silly questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the progress page we can view homework scores. We can also go back and redo the homework still. Obviously we should go back and review our errors but should we also change the answer? Will changing it change the % correct in progress?</li>
<li>
<ol>
<li>Office Hours tab in progress has it marked as 0% complete and 0% correct. I watched the office hours. Should we worry about that %? Will this even remain on the progress tab?<br>

The last time i had to do homework was 15 years back. Learning was not always fun in my live but the older i get the more I look enviously at the things the students can learn today. So i decide to enroll to cs101 at udacity. I thought that's might be fun. i grow up with computers and the money i earned at my first job at thirteen was completly invested into computers. so a the beginning of cs101 it was a little bit boring for me but from unit 3 it was getting more and more exciting. My personal schedule only allowed me to do homework at the weekend. I always submit my homework short bevor closing. And then with unit 6 everything moves out of lane. My first look at unit 6 was possible on saturday. I really never had to do with recrusiv programming. I had to make the experience recrusiv programming is a totaly different kind of thinking. Usually my thoughts are straight therefor recrusiv thinking at the beginning was like mental weightlifting. Tuesday was approaching and my homework was not ready. The straw that broke the camel's back came as unit 7 and the final exam was released before Tueseday and the deadline for the final exam was set to sunday. My homework was not finished, the new unit was out and the deadline for the finale exam was earlier than expected. In my head i could listen to the queen song ""under pressure"". Dave, you always draw smiling faces. You say learning should be fun. At this time for me David Evans became to David the Evil Udacitiator Evans. At Wednesday 01:00 pm (gmt +1) i finished all homeworks from unit 6 exept the last starred and submited it. I was proud to solve the recrusiv parts and yes, i danced in my homeoffice because I was happy, who cares about quicksort. At wednesday afterwork i watched the videos of the last unit and start to solve the questions for the final exam. In compare with homework 6 the unstarred questions was scary easy and i've the feeling to have overlook something, hmm?. Thursday i look at the starred exam question and the nightshift began. Strictly speaking there was two nightshifts thursday and friday necessary to solve the last head nuts and i learned a lot about levenshtein. And finally at saturday 02:00am i finished all questions, delete all debug print statments an submit it. Now after a short sleep (have i mention my two cute little girls like to wake up early?) im sitting in the bathtube, the sun is shinning, David the Evil Udacitiator Evans is back David Evans and i feel blue. I don't agree that David needs a haircut but his shirts could be one size smaller ;-). </p>
<p>Thank you David for kicking my brain, thank you Peter for showing how easy it could be.</p>
<p>I will curse mymself but I've just enrolled for three courses in april</p>

<p>Here is a hint to get you closer to your objective.  Your path comparison is wrong at the bottom of your program.  It should be:</p>
<pre><code>    for char2 in weighted:
        if len(unweighted[char2]) != len(weighted[char2]):
</code></pre>
<p>See?  You are supposed to check the <strong>length</strong> of the shortest unweighted path against the <strong>length</strong> of the shortest path of least weight.  If you change this line, you will see that you are closer to the correct answer.  I haven't gone further on your code than this.  But it's possible that you might sometimes be missing returning the shortest length path in the case where two weighted paths have the same cost.  See the example in my original posting above, where there are two paths of the same weight, but one is shorter than the other... you need to use this shorter path of equal weight for the weighted value.  Hope that sort of makes sense.</p>"	"comment"	"11004418"	"11004136"	"2012-08-03 22:53:33.623649+00"	"1"	""	"\N"	"100011294"	"2012-08-03 22:53:33.623649+00"	"11006602"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

It is not rocket science ......ok so maybe this is rocket science at a manageable level and it represents something that is so scarry to most people.  That is probably the best thing that you have done is that you take something that is unapproachable to most and have made it accessible. Physics is something that to me with Chemistry and Calculus represents the most difficult subjects in high school.  If you can make it accessible to the many then you have done a great thing.  This is like Blues Clues for adults........it is disarming.......it is not fearful and it is enjoyable.  Your approach makes it that way.  Khan gave the address at MIT and he said that his approach was to make the un accessible accessible.  You dont need a lot of money to get an education to learn.  You have done the same thing with the topic of physics. One of the greatest things that I ever saw was one of the directors of a state soccer organization teaching adults how to teach kids to play soccer.  He acted like he really was our coach and we really were six.  Initially I was like surely he is not going to ask us to kick the ball around and then sit on it like we were a chicken waiting or our egg to hatch but he did.  The wisdom was that in making it like a game and being disarming then the atmosphere was more conducive to learning because it was non threatening.  It was a game.......but your approach is very important and it might not be like the Dutch man from MIT but it enables more people to  learn the material.  I wrote all this........it kept on going but I wanted to say I appreciate your approach and I value this experience. Thank you.

<p>Would you be so kind as to compile some resource for premade functions that will likely be used in homeworks/tests so that we can get a feel for what they do and how they operate before we need to use them?</p>
<p>In Dave's 101, and so far (all of chapter 1 coursework, not homework) in Wes' 262, I felt that I was introduced to the functions before they were just magically part of a one line solution.  Perhaps our instructor is expecting that more functions or ways to use them were introduced in 101 than actually were.  Some examples were set, count, max using a key in one and another after that exposure with lambda, list(reversed(, for and ifs used inside returns.  It's not so much that I mind them being used - I'm happy to be exposed to things I don't know, that's why I'm taking the classes.  It's that I don't see them being used before the solution is given makes me worry about the final, that we will be expected to know something we've never been exposed to before.  Even if it's just ""look over the random import and see if there is something there that might be useful.  At least we're given a pointer telling us where to even begin looking.</p>
<p>Also, I very much enjoyed Andy's corner. I almost felt as if I should have watched that first.  In future chapters, I will try that.  However, in list comprehension #4, at the end of the assignment video, you say ""your variable, ta_300, should look exactly like this."" And I made my results look exactly like you requested, and got marked wrong, and after I watched the solution video, saw that you had added ""the"" where you originally had ""is TA for"".  So I changed the concatenated text to match your solution and it was then marked correct.  Being marked wrong for doing what you originally ask does not bother me, but it does earn one /poke. :)</p>"	"answer"	"5000002"	"5000002"	"2012-04-17 12:20:31.402634+00"	"6"	""	"\N"	"100007518"	"2012-04-18 02:16:39.718638+00"	"5000234"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

"1032877"	""	"cs373 "	"100010722"	"<p>Hi. I had a similar set-up as yours (I also own a Mindstorm set) with one ultrasonic sensor rotating on a shaft. I wrote a program in MATLAB to have the sensor rotate 360 degrees forwards and backwards (so not to entangle the cables) and read (about each 10 degrees) the eight echoes that the ultrasonic sensor is capable of registering. I then display this a ""radar like"" graph that polar plots the angle and the points representing these echoes.</p>
<p>The program works and it displays what the robot ""sees"" with the ultrasonic sensor, but this first incursion into sonar reveals some things that are to be solved if one pretends to use these measurements for localization or mapping, or both.</p>
<p>It turns out that while you do get distances to obstacles, the resolution is very low. I suspect this to be due to a wide main lobe in the ultrasonic sensor, so you get echoes that come not only from straight ahead but also from the sides. This is unlike laser rangefinders where you do get a very good reading of distance and direction. </p>
<p>Now, as I see it (and I hope to be modeling and experimenting with this soon) the first step is to empirically determine the characteristics of the sensor; mainly its radiation and sensitivity pattern (both in the vertical and horizontal planes) and possibly detection probabilities according to the type of surface on which the sound bounces back.</p>
<p>After this one could model and test different geometries to predict what sort of sonar response they will give rise to.</p>
<p>When this works one could try localization before mapping (easier problems first!) with a map that describes not only the environment but, for example, texture of the objects (to associate with detection probabilities).</p>
<p>A particle filter would calculate, for each particle, the expected sonar return and calculate the agreement with the actual measurement (the equivalent of the sense and measurement functions) to set the probability of survival of the said particle.</p>
<p>As I see it, it will be a lot of work and that's why I'm using MATLAB and the RWTH Toolbox for Mindstorms. I've been connecting to the Brick with Bluetooth and USB, the latter seems to be a lot more stable but it limits the autonomy of the robot to the cable length. Later Bluetooth will extend the range and finally perhaps the program could be translated to NXC to actually have it run in the brick.</p>
<p>Another option (which also requires work) is to design a better ultrasonic sensor using phased arrays and interface using I2C with the brick. This is much more than I can explain here, but I'll say a microchip PIC has I2C so it's doable (I've built an intelligent claw that is controlled by a servo which is controlled by a PIC that communicates with the Brick, basically to show how the sensors and outputs of the brick can be extended).</p>
<p>Well, those are some ideas I hope to have time to work on. What's your plan?</p>"	"answer"	"1032831"	"1032831"	"2012-04-07 15:50:27.39009+00"	"3"	""	"\N"	"100010933"	"2012-04-07 16:53:13.532181+00"	"1044592"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

With the advent of electricity there is no longer a need to keep the windmills operating but many still turn and work, you can just hook up an electric pump which is more reliable.  There is this one place called Kinderdijk that was lots of windmills in a concentrated area.  I am assuming that there was a lot of water that needed to be raised........you needed a lot of work so you had to have lots of windmills. Just like if you have a heavy load you need lots of horses to pull the wagon.  In any case it is a wonderful site because we do not have them here.  Holland is a wonderful country and very beautiful especially during tulip season and the people are wonderful.  It really was simple but sometimes the windmills failed and had floods but the people learned and that is why they are such great engineers.  </p>

"9003001"	""	"ph100 "	"100030529"	"<p>Based on what Andy suggested, I found equations for d1 and d2.</p>
<p>d1 = 6t + 6. The runner is running as a constant speed (6 m/s), and when t = 0, he is already at 6 m (based on the graph).</p>
<p>d2 is more complicated. Since the bicyclist is accelerating, but hits a constant speed after 4 seconds, d2 has to be a piece-wise function, meaning there are different equations for different times. The first equation, which describes the bicyclist as he's accelerating, is for 0 ≤ t &lt; 4 seconds. The second equation, for when the bicyclist is going at a constant speed, is for t ≥ 4 seconds. (The equal to signs are not fixed, AKA the the time ranges could be 0 ≤ t ≤ 4 seconds and t &gt; 4 seconds.)</p>
<p>Solving the first equation is tricky, since the bicyclist is changing speeds every second. Because the lack of a constant speed, I chose to model the first equation after a quadratic equation, y = at^2 + bt + c. In this equation, y is the distance the bicyclist has gone, and t is the time. So the goal is solve for a, b, and c, which are constants.</p>
<p>We can do this by seeing how far the bicyclist has gone after t seconds. You know that the bicyclist starts at 0 meters and accelerates 3 m/s. So after 1 second, he's gone 3 meters, then after 2 seconds, his speed is now 6 m/s, and he's gone 9 meters. You can continue this out for 4 seconds. <a href=""http://imgur.com/SuBAy"" rel=""nofollow"">This is a table of time (in seconds) and the distance (in meters) the bicyclist, b, has gone after 4 seconds.</a> Using this table, you can substitute and solve for a, b, and c. You will need three equations. Luckily, the table above provides enough points to solve. After some algebra, you will find that c = 0, b = 1.5, and a = 1.5. The the equation for the cyclist from time 0 to 4 seconds is y = 1.5t^2 + 1.5t.</p>
<p>The second equation is easy to solve. After 4 seconds, the bicyclist has a constant speed of 12 m/s. You know that after 4 seconds, the bicyclist has gone 30 meters. So the equation becomes y = 12t - 18.</p>
<p>The final, piece-wise equation for the distance the bicyclist traveled looks like <a href=""http://imgur.com/OJtmZ"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a>. </p>
<p>Now, as Andy said, set d1 and d2 equal to each other and solve for t. You'll find that whichever equation of d2 you use, you will find that it equals d1 at t = 4 seconds.</p>"	"answer"	"9002489"	"9002489"	"2012-07-04 21:15:04.435487+00"	"0"	""	"9025003"	"100007518"	"2012-07-04 21:21:28.135564+00"	"9003770"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

<p>NASA has a system that constructs optimal algorithms for the Mars rovers and other limited-capability systems.  It optimizes things like square roots, sines, and signal transforms for specific needs and data characteristics, including the number of bits of accuracy required.  And proves the algorithm correct, for the target architecture.  That code then runs in an environment that considers rover time constraints, power limits, and priorities -- also proven correct, as nearly as current technology allows.  And this is in service to goals uploaded from Earth -- goals that are themselves developed within an optimal planning framework.</p>
<p>Here's another example: the <a href=""http://www.kurzweilai.net/graphics-software-gets-faster-and-easier-to-write"" rel=""nofollow"">Halide</a> image processing program compiler for parallel hardware.  Compared to hand-optimized code,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Halide versions were typically about one-third as long but offered<br>
significant performance gains — two-, three-, or even six-fold<br>
speedups. In one instance, the Halide program was actually longer than<br>
the original — but the speedup was 70-fold.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And after taking Steve Hoffman's CS253 to build my own blog or wiki, I learned that one can create either application -- and much more -- with just a few parameter settings in <a href=""http://showmedo.com/videotutorials/series?name=v7kABKL6R"" rel=""nofollow"">Django</a>.

Wouldn't $% a = \frac{g\sin{\alpha}}{1+I/mr^{2}} $% ? where I is the moment of inertia. (assuming it is some sort of a spherical/cylindrical body that rolls (without slipping). So, the value of 'g' obtained would be off by a factor of $% 1 + I/mr^{2} $% which can be off by quite a large amount.</p>"	"answer"	"9002741"	"9002741"	"2012-07-03 18:05:28.722055+00"	"1"	"(accepted)"	"\N"	"100007518"	"2012-07-03 18:45:34.514255+00"	"9003441"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"t"

Michael defines it in the lecture as <i>""given graph G, [...] l and two nodes u and v, is there are a simple path from u to v consisting of l or mode nodes""</i>. Again, <b><i>""l or more nodes""</i></b>. For example, if there is a simple path consisting of exactly two nodes, then by definition, decision problem for any l&lt;=2 shall return TRUE. The only thing that is missing from this definition in my view is a restriction on the domain of possible l values, i.e. can l be a 1, 0 or a negative number? If you look at <code>long_and_simple_decision</code> implementation in the test harness you will find that it returns FALSE for l = 0.

<p>@Goldsong - I do agree that, in the absence of the ""Udacity"" name itself currently meaning anything, the weight of the instructors' names is perhaps the only indication of the approximate quality of a course. However, as has been discussed previously on this forum (and a distinction made clear by Udacity itself), there is a big difference between ""A course taught by a professor at Stanford"" -vs- ""A course taught at Stanford"". </p>

Although your suggested phrasing is completely factually accurate, by including the ""Stanford""/""Google"" name in the same line as the name of the course, it appears to give Udacity courses some authority that they do not have. If an employer considers that to be misleading, expect your application to be thrown out very quickly!</p>
<p>What I firmly hope is that, over time, a body of Udacity ""graduates"" will go on to achieve great things on their own merit and the reputation of the Udacity institution will rise in its own right, negating the need to hang on the (stellar) reputation of its lecturers alone.</p>"	"comment"	"10010207"	"10010057"	"2012-08-03 11:21:50.373662+00"	"0"	""	"\N"	"100006690"	"2012-08-03 11:21:50.373662+00"	"10014495"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"

If this post violates any of the forum policies, please let me know, and I will promptly close/delete it. </p>
<p>Some of my suggestions have already been mentioned by others (see <a href=""http://www.udacity-forums.com/cs101/questions/75/suggestions-for-the-course"" rel=""nofollow"">Suggestions for the Course</a>).</p>
<hr>
<h1>Homework Handling</h1>
<h2>1. Instant incorrect/correct flagging.</h2>
<p>It would be beneficial to allow a student to know whether or not their solution is correct upon submission. To mitigate such this method, allow for a series of retries, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only 1 try on multiple choice questions (2 tries if there is more than 1 correct answer)</li>
<li>2-3 tries on free response and programming questions</li>
</ul>
<p>Solutions should still only be posted after the deadline has passed. There are some pros and cons to this suggestion:</p>
<p><strong>PROS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>More students can confidently advise other students</li>
<li>Everyone makes mistakes; this method would allow students to re-think their (incorrect) solutions, while supplying some more guided discussion on particularly troublesome problems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>CONS:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People are able to make multiple accounts to 'try/guess' questions, submitting only the correct solutions on their main accounts</li>
<li>Ultimately, it is up to an individual's moral integrity, on whether or not to exploit this possibility of retries with multiple accounts</li>
<li>The possibility of more temptation, for students to discuss (the correct) solutions before the deadline</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Supply a 'black box' function/procedure for programming assignments</h2>
<p>To clarify, let me use the max depth question from HW 3:</p>
<p>The 'black box' function (the function's internal code is not shown) supplied would work exactly as how the student's final crawl_web function is expected work for the HW problem (i.e. print out all the URLs up to the inputted depth value). This will allow students to test out certain behavioral aspects of the function. This would also limit the number of questions (and doubts) regarding 'corner cases/undefined behavior' in the HW. </p>
<hr>
<h1>Grading</h1>
<h2>1. Different grading weight for starred and non-starred questions.</h2>
<p>This suggestion has already been discussed, but I would like to offer some proposals as to what to do with starred and non-starred questions. One option, would be to only have all non-starred questions be counted as HW grades. Starred questions can be counted as extra credit, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make up credit for having an incorrect non-starred question</li>
<li>For each starred question answered correctly, give a 0.5-1% extra credit on the student's final grade</li>
</ul>
<h2>2. Partial credit on HW problems.</h2>
<p>This is how I imagine programming problems are currently being graded (please correct me if I am wrong): For each submission, the student's program/code is 'included' into a test file, which has a procedure with individual test cases. This procedure consists of various 'if' statements, which check the result/output of the student's code (against various inputs, in certain cases), and reports whether the results match what is expected (i.e. returns TRUE or FALSE). If any such test case fails, the HW problem is marked as incorrect.</p>
<p>Thus, one method to supply partial credit, is to have each individual test case be a 'partial' point. If a student's code passes 5/6 test cases, then the credit awarded would be ((5/6) * (total point value of question)). The same general principle can be applied to multiple choice questions which have more than one correct answer.</p>
<hr>
<p>These suggestions are by no means perfect, and are my personal opinions. Please let me know if any clarification is needed on any of the topics detailed above. I would enjoy hearing other student's personal suggestions and opinion on the matter. Likewise, please feel free to supply any criticism on my suggestions.</p>
<p>This post is not meant to demean the HW logistics of CS101/Udacity as it is now. I apologize if my post comes off as such. I truly appreciate what Udacity is trying to accomplish, by offering top-notch classes to the masses. I hope that they continue to do so.</p>"	"question"	"\N"	"\N"	"2012-03-17 21:07:03.964805+00"	"2"	""	"131759"	"100007540"	"2012-03-24 15:06:54.287521+00"	"54056"	"\N"	"\N"	"378"	"f"

<p>w.r.t. naming the instructor, Alastair's point is well taken.  However, unfortunatelly, if Udacity is just in the process of building its reputation and thus it is not known in, say, a university in Bangladesh, mentioning Udacity in the CV is not effective if you are applying to such university.  Once Udacity gets a reputation of its own, mentioning the instructor is irrelevant but in the meantime, I do not think so.  Still, I can certainly see the point.</p>
<p>On the other hand, personally I think that having had Sebastian or Peter as instructors is more important than having taken the specific class.  These are people that are so prominent in their respective fields, so experienced, that they would have full classes in any university regardless of the class they teach.  Many people taking this class are not aware that Sebastian consistently had packed standing-only talks at international conferences long before he joined Stanford.  In other words, I would take any class in any online organization (Udacity, EdX, Coursera) taught by either of them and it is to my great sorrow that I did not learn about their original AI class until after it was over.  Not all teachers in Udacity are Thrun or Norvig, though, but just mentioning the affiliation of the instructor with a reputable university gives credence to the online class.</p>
<p>The way I see it, if you had the opportunity to take a kinesiology class with Michael Jordan while you were still in high-school would you care what specific class it was?  Would you omit from the cv that you had Michael Jordan as an instructor?  Well.. it might be the case that I am just a big fan of Michael but I do not think so.</p>"	"comment"	"10010207"	"10010057"	"2012-08-03 08:31:25.160938+00"	"1"	""	"10117368"	"100008281"	"2012-08-03 08:32:38.927981+00"	"10014483"	"\N"	"\N"	"0"	"f"
